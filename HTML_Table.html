<p>As our understanding of other planets, the Solar System and the universe grows, we are collectively realizing that intelligent life simply must exist outside of Earth.

	<summary>Higher levels of vibration</summary>
<p>Throughout creation, life can exist on different levels of vibration. So while NASA may be searching for extraterrestrial life “as we know it” on the planet Mars, they’re looking on the same level of vibration as we exist on Earth today - this physical plane.

If NASA were able to travel to the higher levels of vibration on Mars, then they would find a planet full of advanced life.</p>
